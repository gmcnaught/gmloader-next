// Phase 4 Stage B — the deferred full-screen clear.
//
// The game's glClear reaches mf_clear() and is emitted as a ring BLT_OP_FILL
// over the whole 288x216 target: 62,208 pixels at ~1 px/cyc = 0.632 ms of every
// frame, and it lands in the fabric's `ovhd` term (a ring FILL dispatches
// through comp_pipeline, not through the S_TRI_* states `tri` counts).
//
// On the captured streams the opaque draws already repaint the whole screen
// (COPY covers 125,568 px over 62,208 unique), so that fill is redundant. But
// mf_clear() cannot know it: the draws have not arrived yet. So it DEFERS --
// records the fill here -- and the decision is made at the first subsequent
// draw, in mf_emit_group, which is both the single point every surviving draw
// passes and the only place the fabric blend mode is resolved.
//
// THE PROOF IS EXACT, NOT A BOUNDING BOX. Two thin slivers at opposite corners
// have a full-screen bbox and cover almost nothing. mf_pc_is_cover instead
// requires each triangle to be three DISTINCT corners of the target rect, with
// the two triangles together hitting all four: two such triangles are each
// exactly half the rect and are the two complementary halves, so their union is
// the whole rect.
//
// Any condition not provably met emits the fill. The permitted failure is a
// lost 0.632 ms, never a stale pixel.
//
// Pure by construction: no I/O, no globals, no device headers, no engine types,
// so the whole decision is unit-testable on the host.
